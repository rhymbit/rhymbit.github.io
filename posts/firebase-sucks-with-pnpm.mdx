title: Firebase Sucks With PnPm
description: Everything's fine, until you build the project and it throws error in your builder's (e.g. rollup) code.

When using firebase in any project, for example in your astro project,
and things just straight up not work for some reason or other,
then just try :-

- remove/delete `node_modules` folder
- `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist` instead of normal `pnpm install`

**Pnpm** has this strict module structure and **firebase** has deep
dependencies that **vite** cannot resolve (which uses **rollup** under the hood) if
dependencies are installed using `pnpm install`.

The `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist` install the dependencies just like `npm install`,
which is messy, but that's what works for now.

There's no way to properly explain this, so I'll start by linking a discord
example of what's going on (it's also got nice screenshots).

If you can't access discord, then here's what happened:-  
> I got this error `lifecycle_outside_component` in a newly created SvelteKit project.
It's related to using `onMount` outside of `<script></script>`, which nobody will do, but
thats what that error said.  
Crazy thing, I didn't even had a single `onMount` anywhere in my code, which was just 3 `.svelte` files, since
it was a brand new project.

And `lifecycle_outside_component` error is not the only one I've got when working with
a Svelte project with pnpm.

I've always wondered why Svelte & SvelteKit docs never mention other ways to create
a new project besides with `npm`.

There's definitely some errors & insane bugs you get only when using `pnpm` or `yarn`
but they magically disappear when using `npm`.

I don't know the reason, and nobody in their Discord have any idea either.

For now **the only solution** to all these problems is to simply use `npm`.
